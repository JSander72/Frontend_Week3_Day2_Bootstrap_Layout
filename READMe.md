# Tech Solutions Service Page

This is a basic webpage built using Bootstrap 5 to showcase the services offered by a fictional company called "Tech Solutions."

## Features

Responsive Layout: The page is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, providing a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Service Cards: The services are presented in visually appealing cards with images, titles, and brief descriptions.
About Us Section: A dedicated section provides information about the company, along with a sidebar highlighting the key services.
Contact Form: A simple contact form allows users to inquire about specific services.

## How to Use

Make sure you have Bootstrap 5 included in your project. You can either download it or use a CDN link like the one provided in the HTML.

If you want the contact form to function, you'll need to implement the necessary JavaScript code in index.js to handle form submission and potentially send the data to a server.
